  <h2>JavaScript</h2>
  <p>JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language.
     It is a small and lightweight language. Inside a host environment
     (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the
     objects of its environment to provide programmatic control over them.
    JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array, Date,
     and Math, and a core set of language elements such as operators, control
      structures, and statements. Core JavaScript can be extended for
       a variety of purposes by supplementing it with additional objects;
        for example:
        <ul>
          <li>Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying
             objects to control a browser and its Document Object Model (DOM).
             For example, client-side extensions allow an application to place
             elements on an HTML form and respond to user events such as mouse
              clicks, form input, and page navigation. </li>
          <li>Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying
             objects relevant to running JavaScript on a server. For example,
              server-side extensions allow an application to communicate with
               a database, provide continuity of information from one invocation
                to another of the application, or perform file manipulations on a server.</li>
        </ul>
